# Volcanic Risk Modeling Using Machine Learning

## Abstract

This project applies data mining techniques in R to analyze volcanic risk using global data from the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program. The team explores three key questions:

1. Can a volcanoâ€™s physical characteristics, such as type, elevation, and tectonic setting, be used to predict whether it is likely to erupt explosively?  
2. Can the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of a future eruption be estimated based on volcano traits and eruption history?  
3. Which volcanoes pose the greatest hazard when considering both population exposure and eruption frequency?

To address these questions, we will build machine learning models for classification, regression, and clustering. Together, these models provide a multi-dimensional view of volcanic hazard with potential applications in risk assessment and disaster preparedness.
